FEH Robot Team C2, led by student researchers Jason Ahern, Stuti Shah, Andy Yu, and Chris Zhao, is seeking to solve the Carmen’s Diner problem of efficiency with a world-class worker robot. These students are hoping that their state-of-the-art robot design will be selected to serve Carmen’s Diner in the future.
